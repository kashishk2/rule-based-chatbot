# Task 1 â€“ Rule-Based Chatbot

This project is a basic rule-based chatbot developed as part of Task 1 for the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Internship at CodSoft.

## Overview

The chatbot is designed to interact with users using simple rule-based logic. It identifies certain keywords or phrases in the user's input and responds accordingly. If the input does not match any known pattern, the chatbot provides a default response.

## Key Features

- Personalized greeting using the user's name
- Responds to basic user queries such as:
  - Greetings ("hello", "hi")
  - Asking about the chatbot ("your name")
  - Politeness ("thank you")
  - Humor ("tell me a joke")
  - Support ("help")
- Exits the conversation upon receiving "bye"
- Handles unrecognized inputs with a polite message

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python 3.x
- Logic: Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)
- Input/Output: Command-line interaction

## How to Run

Ensure Python is installed on your system. Follow these steps to run the chatbot:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the folder containing the script
3. Run the script using the command: 
python chatbot.py
